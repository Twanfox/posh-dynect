# What Is the DynECT PowerShell Module?
The DynECT PowerShell module is a way to manipulate DNS records from [Dyn.com's Managed DNS Service](https://dyn.com/dns/managed-dns/)

## History of the module
This module originated as a way for me to manipulate DNS host records in conjunction with the ACMESharp PowerShell Module for acquiring certificates from Let's Encrypt. While I have previously used Dyn's Standard DNS Service in the past, I found the idea of being able to make REST API calls to modify the records and zone data appealing. In Fall 2017, I subscribed to Dyn's Managed DNS service to give this effort a try and this module is the result of my tinkering.
